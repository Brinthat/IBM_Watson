# IBM_Watson
Projects for IBM watson

1. What is Generative AI and How Can It Be Applied?
Delved into concepts of generative AI with IBM watsonx.ai, explored foundation models (e.g., Lama-2-13b-chat), the prompt lab, and tuning Studio for tasks like conversation summaries, sorting customer complaints, blog posts, product-specific Q/A and code generation.

2. Crafting Conversations: The Art and Science of Prompt Engineering
Gained insights into prompt engineering, and how tokens are generated in the example marketing email generation with different model parameters like greedy, sampling, temperature, top P, and K.

3. Conversational Intelligence Unleashed: Building Context-Aware Chatbots
Developed generative AI-powered chatbots using IBM Watson Assistant with LLM framework, deep dive into actions to enhance conversational intelligence.

4. Exploring RAG: The Cutting-Edge Design Pattern in Generative AI
Learned about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its applications in AI.

5. Building Trust: Strategies for Creating Ethical AI Systems
Understood the importance of ethical practices in AI development and how to create trustworthy systems.

6. Generating Better Data: Exploring Synthetic Tabular Data Techniques
Explored custom schema and mimic data approach for generating synthetic data to optimize AI model performance on Watsonx.ai with evaluation metrics.
